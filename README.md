# Abstract
The introduction of machine learning to sports has the potential to completely revolutionize how sports are conducted. For example, Anna Keisenhofer, a math genius, was able to win an olympic medal despite not being a professional athlete. She was able to use a computer model to analyze the method with which she should pedal, taking into account temperature, moisture, and other factors. The olympic sport of fencing is an individual sport that involves complex body motion, and analyzing opponents has always been difficult and time consuming. We hope to explore the plausibility of using newer technologies such as deep learning to analyze fencers. 

# Introduction
This project is dedicated towards creating an artificial intelligence capable of analyzing fencers through deep learning. We will specifically be examining foil/epee. The general skeleton of our system relies on using motion capture technology to input data into our AI, and applying deep learning technology to analyze moves that are successful and those that are less successful. IOTs have already been developed that allow for whole body motion capture, and we hope to use something similar to conduct our motion capturing. We also hope to be able to incorporate data from a variety of sources such as youtube videos and fencing clips taken by fencers, so we will create fencer skeletons and extract motion data from such sources. We will categorize moves as strong or weak against certain people by examining the effectiveness over a certain amount of touches, and other factors such as how difficult the move itself is to do. Our theoretical program will be capable of suggesting to an athlete the moves that he/she should take to win against a certain opponent.
